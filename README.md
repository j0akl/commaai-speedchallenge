# Dashcam Speed Detection Neural Net

my response to the comma.ai programming challenge

after submitting to the people at comma, I was given a MSE of 84 on the test set. There is a lot of improvement to be made here, however I think this was a good demonstration of my basic knowledge of machine learning algorithms, as well as some basic data manipulation and manual feature discovery.

Work is now being done in a gradient notebook located at https://console.paperspace.com/teg4lwuqw/notebook/rlpi7v5b4kd6bw
Currently waiting on loss for the second attempt
